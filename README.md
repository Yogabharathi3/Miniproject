# AR FOR EXTINCT ANIMALIA

The purpose  of  this  project  is  to  develop  an  android-based  application  that showcases  endangered  and  extinct  species  in  three  dimensions.

# About
Throughout the history of Earth, numerous species have gone extinct due to natural events, climate change, and human activities. Many of these extinct animals, from the dinosaurs to prehistoric mammals, played crucial roles in the ecosystems of their time, but we can only learn about them through fossils,research, and artistic interpretations. While this traditional approach provides valuable insights, it often lacks the ability to fully convey what these animals looked like in their natural environments or how they behaved. This gap in experiential knowledge has motivated the development of the "Augmented Reality (AR) for Extinct Animalia" project, which aims to recreate extinct species in a virtual, interactive format.

# Features

2.Contextual Environments
AR scenes with historically accurate habitats, such as prehistoric forests, ice age tundras, or island ecosystems.

3.Education Mode
Information pop-ups explaining the animal’s diet, habitat, extinction causes, and time period.Layers that toggle skeletal structures or internal anatomy.

4.Scale Comparison
Feature to view animals at their actual size or scaled down for practical use in smaller spaces.

5.Time Travel Mode

7.AR Integration:
Utilize AR SDKs like ARKit (iOS), ARCore (Android), or platforms like Unity and Unreal Engine for development.

8.Machine Learning for Reconstruction:
Incorporate AI tools to predict and reconstruct appearance based on fossils and DNA evidence.

9.Geolocation Integration:
Allow users to explore extinct animals native to their region using GPS.

10.Mobile and AR Glasses Compatibility:
Design for smartphones and AR glasses like the Meta Quest or Microsoft HoloLens.

11.Potential Uses
Education: Museums, schools, and science centers.
Entertainment: Interactive gaming experiences featuring extinct creatures.
Conservation Awareness: Highlight the importance of protecting endangered species to prevent future extinctions.
